1. We need a simple service with Web API using REST principles
2. Methods to be implemented in API:
- save file (size is from 0 bytes up to 1GB) to local disk (file will be transfered in request body)
- calc sha256 hash of stored file (return value must be string presentation of sha256 hash)
- delete stored file from local disk
3. Use Basic authorization. Please store user/pwd in web.config to be simple
4. Add Swagger interface to test API
5. Please use unit tests and IoC, good SOLID practice is required.
6. Correct handling of errors is required.
7. It is strong recomented to do not allow user to delete file during sha256 hash is calculating. Please return some HTTP error in this case.
8. Please provide the possible improving of project in future in the direction (without large architecture changes) 
- of saving the file to Azure storage 
- scalability of instances count
